## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze NYC Citibike data to support a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa. We analyzed a dataset from August 2019 that had numerous data points such as trip duration, starting location, ending location, gender, subscriber or customer, etc. A Tableau story was created using data from 2.3M rides that were taken in August 2019. A set of visualizations were created to show different aspects of the data. 

## Results
2.3M rides were analyzed:

Starting location bubble sizes were mapped according to frequency of starting location:

Trip duration was also visualized:

Checkout times by gender showed a heavily male customer base:

## Summary
In studying the data and the visualizations, we can infer most of the rides are taken for commuting purposes. Much of our ride traffic occurs during 7-9am and 5-7pm, respectively. The starting locations also happen to heavily be weighted towards the borough of Manhattan due to the density of office buildings as well as tourists. An observation to possible investors in Des Moines, the vast majority of rides were below 22 minutes long. This indicates riders take shorter rides by length all else equal. Stop lights in NYC certainly play a factor. The increased foot traffic in NYC presents more opportunities for ride time whereas Des Moines is sparsely populated relative to NYC. Tourist rides were evident during the day time hours of weekends in NYC. Des Moines may not have that same tourist population visiting their city. 

Another visualization suggestion would be to further break down starting and ending location data filtered by subscribers to the service only. That would allow Citibike to place more bikes closer to the most popular starting locations for their subscribers. Another point that should be studied is the starting and ending location by start time since a large proportion of the rides occur during commuting hours in the AM and PM.
