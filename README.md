## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze NYC Citibike data to support a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa. We analyzed a dataset from August 2019 that had numerous data points such as trip duration, starting location, ending location, gender, subscriber or customer, etc. A Tableau story was created using data from 2.3M rides that were taken in August 2019. A set of visualizations were created to show different aspects of the data. 

## Results
2.3M rides were analyzed:
